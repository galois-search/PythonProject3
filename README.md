# Overview
This repo contains files to generate some legendre sequences by combining two prime numbers which sums to 1500 and calculate their ACR and CCR value.

# File Description
- `Main_Program_V2.py` is the main file to generate sequences using those combinations from `combinations.txt` file.
- `legendre_sequence_generator.py` is to generate legendre sequences.
- `combined_legendre.py` file to combine two legendre sequences and then find their ACR and CCR.
- `LunaNet_signal.py` file is to find the ACR value by generating the LunaNet signals.
- `legendre_V2.py` file is to generate two legendre sequences and the flip the bits of one sequence.

# Output
- `Output_data_100.txt` is the output file for 100 bits sequence combinations.
- For 1500 bits the file size was large so can't be uploaded you can generate the output by running the `Main_Program_V2.py` file.
